# Teacher Dashboard Upload Feature Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds real file upload functionality to the teacher dashboard using Supabase Storage. Teachers can upload educational materials (notes and assignments) that are automatically organized into the correct folder structure based on year, subject combination, and subject.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Real File Upload
- File upload to Supabase Storage with proper folder organization
- Support for PDF, DOC, DOCX, images, ZIP, and 7Z files
- File size validation (25MB limit)
- File type validation

### ✅ Smart Folder Organization
- Automatic folder structure based on form data
- 1st year support with Physics/Chemistry combinations
- Extensible for 2nd, 3rd, 4th years

### ✅ Database Integration
- Upload records stored in `teacher_uploads` table
- User isolation (teachers can only see their own uploads)
- Status tracking (Pending, Approved, Rejected)

### ✅ User Interface
- Loading states during upload
- Real-time upload list with download links
- Form validation and error handling
- Toast notifications for user feedback

## Database Schema

### teacher_uploads Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE teacher_uploads (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  year TEXT NOT NULL,
  semester TEXT,
  subject_combo TEXT,
  subject TEXT NOT NULL,
  type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('Notes', 'Assignment')),
  description TEXT,
  file_path TEXT NOT NULL,
  download_url TEXT,
  file_size BIGINT,
  file_name TEXT,
  uploaded_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'Pending' CHECK (status IN ('Pending', 'Approved', 'Rejected')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
Run the SQL from `supabase & databse/databse-setup/teacher_uploads.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor.

### 2. Storage Bucket Setup
Follow the instructions in `supabase & databse/STORAGE_SETUP.md` to:
- Create the `teacher-uploads` bucket
- Configure storage policies
- Set up file type and size limits

### 3. Environment Variables
Ensure your `.env.local` has:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 4. Test the Setup
Visit `/test-storage` to run automated tests and verify everything is working.

## Usage

### For Teachers

1. **Navigate to Teacher Dashboard**
   - Go to `/teacher-dashboard`
   - Log in with teacher credentials

2. **Upload a Document**
   - Fill in the form with document details
   - Select year (1st year)
   - Choose subject combination (Physics and PPS / Chemistry and Civil)
   - Select specific subject
   - Choose type (Notes or Assignment)
   - Add optional description
   - Upload file (PDF, DOC, DOCX, images, ZIP, 7Z)
   - Click "Upload Document"

3. **View Uploads**
   - See all uploaded documents in the right panel
   - Click the file icon to download
   - View upload status and details

### For Developers

1. **Testing Storage**
   ```typescript
   import { testStorageSetup } from '@/lib/test-storage'
   
   // Run comprehensive storage tests
   const success = await testStorageSetup()
   ```

2. **Uploading Files Programmatically**
   ```typescript
   import { uploadFile, saveUploadRecord } from '@/lib/storage'
   
   const uploadData = {
     title: "Sample Notes",
     year: "1",
     subjectCombo: "Physics and PPS",
     subject: "Physics",
     type: "Notes",
     description: "Sample description",
     file: fileObject
   }
   
   const result = await uploadFile(uploadData)
   if (result.success) {
     await saveUploadRecord(uploadData, result)
   }
   ```

## Security Features

- **File Validation**: Type and size validation before upload
- **User Isolation**: Teachers can only access their own uploads
- **Row Level Security**: Database policies prevent unauthorized access
- **Public Downloads**: Files are publicly accessible via download URLs

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Upload Errors**: File size, type, and network errors
- **Database Errors**: Connection and constraint violations
- **Authentication Errors**: Unauthorized access attempts
- **User Feedback**: Toast notifications for all error states

## Performance Considerations

- **File Size Limit**: 25MB per file
- **CDN Delivery**: Supabase automatically serves files through CDN
- **Caching**: Files cached for 1 hour (configurable)
- **Batch Operations**: Ready for future batch upload features

## Future Enhancements

1. **Batch Upload**: Upload multiple files at once
2. **File Preview**: Preview PDFs and images before upload
3. **Version Control**: Track file versions and updates
4. **Approval Workflow**: Admin approval for uploads
5. **Search and Filter**: Search through uploaded files
6. **File Compression**: Automatic compression for large files
7. **Analytics**: Track download counts and usage statistics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Bucket not found"**
   - Verify bucket name is exactly `teacher-uploads`
   - Check bucket exists in correct Supabase project

2. **"Policy violation"**
   - Ensure user is authenticated
   - Verify storage policies are correctly configured

3. **"File too large"**
   - Check file size limit in bucket settings
   - Ensure file is under 25MB

4. **"Invalid MIME type"**
   - Check allowed MIME types in bucket settings
   - Ensure file type is supported

### Debug Steps

1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Use `/test-storage` page for automated testing
3. Verify Supabase client configuration
4. Check network tab for failed requests
5. Verify user authentication status
