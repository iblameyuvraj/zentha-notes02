## üé® Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types and interfaces
- Avoid `any` type - use proper typing
- Use strict mode in `tsconfig.json`

### React/Next.js

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use proper prop types and interfaces
- Implement proper error boundaries

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case for file names: `user-profile.tsx`
- Use PascalCase for components: `UserProfile`
- Use camelCase for functions and variables: `getUserData`

### Code Organization

```typescript
// 1. Imports (external, internal, relative)
import React from 'react'
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
import { useAuth } from '@/hooks/use-auth'

// 2. Types and interfaces
interface UserProfileProps {
  userId: string
  onUpdate?: (data: UserData) => void
}

// 3. Component definition
export function UserProfile({ userId, onUpdate }: UserProfileProps) {
  // 4. Hooks
  const { user, loading } = useAuth()
  
  // 5. Event handlers
  const handleUpdate = (data: UserData) => {
    onUpdate?.(data)
  }
  
  // 6. Render
  return (
    <div>
      {/* JSX content */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Comments and Documentation

# Run specific test file
pnpm test -- --testPathPattern=storage
```

### Writing Tests

```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import { UserProfile } from './user-profile'

describe('UserProfile', () => {
  it('renders user information correctly', () => {
    render(<UserProfile userId="123" />)
    expect(screen.getByText('User Profile')).toBeInTheDocument()
