# Uploaded Notes and Assignments Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds the ability for students to view and download notes and assignments uploaded by teachers through the storage system. The feature is integrated into the existing student dashboard pages.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Functions (`lib/storage.ts`)
- **`getAllApprovedUploads()`**: Fetches all approved teacher uploads with teacher information
- **`getApprovedUploadsByFilter()`**: Fetches filtered uploads based on criteria (year, semester, subject, type, subject combo)

### 2. Database Policies (`zAll setups/databse-setup/student_access_policies.sql`)
- Added policy to allow all authenticated users to view approved uploads
- Teachers can still only view/edit/delete their own uploads
- Students can view all approved uploads

### 3. Uploaded Content Component (`components/ui/uploaded-content.tsx`)
- **Filtering**: By year, semester, subject, type, and subject combination
- **Display**: Cards showing upload details including teacher name, file size, upload date
- **Download**: Direct download functionality for uploaded files
- **AI Integration**: ChatGPT integration for uploaded content
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly grid layout

### 4. Dashboard Integration
- **Chemistry Dashboard** (`app/dashboard1/chemistry/page.tsx`): Added tabs for RTU Papers and Teacher Uploads
- **Physics Dashboard** (`app/dashboard1/physics/page.tsx`): Added tabs for RTU Papers and Teacher Uploads
- **Tab Interface**: Clean separation between static RTU papers and dynamic teacher uploads

## Key Features

### Filtering System
- **Year Filter**: Filter by academic year
- **Semester Filter**: Filter by semester (1st/2nd)
- **Subject Filter**: Filter by specific subjects
- **Type Filter**: Filter by Notes or Assignment
- **Subject Combo Filter**: Filter by subject combination (Physics and PPS, Chemistry, etc.)

### Display Information
- **File Details**: Title, subject, year, semester, type
- **Teacher Information**: Teacher name/email
- **File Metadata**: File size, upload date, description
- **Download Status**: Direct download links
- **AI Integration**: ChatGPT assistance for uploaded content

### User Experience
- **Loading States**: Spinner while fetching data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no uploads found
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Dark Mode Support**: Consistent with existing theme

## Database Schema

### teacher_uploads Table
```sql

## Storage Structure
Files are stored in Supabase Storage with the following structure:
```
teacher-uploads/
├── 1st year/
│   ├── chemistry/
│   │   ├── notes/
│   │   │   ├── chemistry/
│   │   │   ├── civil/
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   └── assignment/
│   │       ├── chemistry/
│   │       └── ...
│   └── physics/
│       ├── notes/
│       │   ├── physics/
│       │   ├── bee/
│       │   └── ...
│       └── assignment/
│           ├── physics/
│           └── ...
```

## Security
- **Row Level Security**: Students can only view approved uploads
